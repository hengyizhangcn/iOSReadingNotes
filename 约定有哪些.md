shared+类类型

Several Cocoa framework classes are singletons. They include `NSFileManager`, `NSWorkspace`, and, in UIKit, `UIApplication` and `UIAccelerometer`. The name of the factory method returning the singleton instance has, by convention, the form `shared`*ClassType*. Examples from the Cocoa frameworks are `sharedFileManager`, `sharedColorPanel`, and `sharedWorkspace`.
